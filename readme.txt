1) Type 'make' to make the cell devs model for erosion
   and the new version of drawlog.
2) Type RunErosion.bat to simulate the erosion model and
   generate the files output0.drw and output1.drw used 
   by graflog.
3) Using 2 cygwin shells, execute graph0.bat and graph1.bat
   in separate shells.  This requires the 3D version of graflog 
   Then play with the erosion model.  As will I recommend using 
   graflog to view 2D slices of the 3D model using the -f option.  
   If clarification of the erosion model is required it can be 
   found in the Assign3Report.doc
